DP:
1. Sub-problems (simplify problem)
2. Reusing the same function/computation
3. memorization (avoid repeating same computation)
4. Think "bottom-up" i.e. starting from the base/simplest case
5. Order of solving sub-problems matter, it has a topological order of solving (think DAG)

Note: sub-problems need to be acyclic i.e. not repeating the same computation

5 "easy steps" to DP:
1. define sub problems
2. guess (part of solution) and then select the best
3. relate sub problem solutions
4. recurse & memorize or build DP table bottom up
