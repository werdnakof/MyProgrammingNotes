FSM Presentation

Intro

- What is finite state machine?
- A mathematical model of computation. 
- It is an abstract machine
- Consists of a finite number of states
- Only one state is active/present at any given time.
- Transition: the FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs
 - Example: locked door
- Applications of FSM: Compiler, Regular Expressions, Artifical intelligence

Goal

- given the topic of finite automata  in computer science field is quite established, goal is not to carry out further research on FSM
- Goal is to implement the theories such as finite automata conversions
- and create the application which allows users to visualize FSM.
- Normally described by a set mathematical notations
- Can be described by state diagrams

Work

- create a design specification so that there is target to meet and it would constraint our deliverables.
- create different possible solutions e.g. desktop vs web applications, programming languages, frameworks
- rank them against the specification to see which one is better
- create the application, use version control, open sourced
- evaluate by sample users to collect feedback and fix any bugs
- improve the software based on feedback
