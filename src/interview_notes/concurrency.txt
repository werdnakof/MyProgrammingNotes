Parallel vs Concurrent

1. Parallel is opposite of Serial
2. Concurrent is opposite of Sequential
3. Vector is opposite of Scalar

Concurrency is about DEALING with lots of things at once

Parallelism is about DOING with lots of things at once

CPU caches:
Cost of getting from memory is greater than cpu cache

Need to protect thread-shared data structures from locking,
deal with mutual exclusions,
each thread runs from beginning to end which then flushes cpu cache


Pipelines:
Splitting an sequential application into small stages each running its own concurrent thread (see 7:53 at video)

Batching:
Collecting a bunch of task and executing them in one go.
