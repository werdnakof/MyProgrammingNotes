CAP theorem

CAP is Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Basically you can pick 2 of those but you can't do all 3.

ACID focuses on Consistency and availability.

BASE focuses on Partition tolerance and availability and throws consistency out the window.

ACID vs BASE

ACID
Atomic - All operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back.
Consistent - On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound.
Isolated - Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.
Durable - The results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of failures.

Base
Basic Availability - The database appears to work most of the time.
Soft-state - Stores donâ€™t have to be write-consistent, nor do different replicas have to be mutually consistent all the time.
Eventual consistency - Stores exhibit consistency at some later point (e.g., lazily at read time).
